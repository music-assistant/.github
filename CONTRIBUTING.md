# Contributing to Music Assistant

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Music Assistant. Even if you are not a developer, perhaps you would like to help with the [documentation](https://music-assistant.io)? If you are a developer and have a music service or speaker that isn't supported by Music Assistant yet, why not spend a couple of hours and help to integrate it?

The process is straight-forward.

 - Fork the relevant Music Assistant repository (e.g. [server](https://github.com/music-assistant/server), [frontend](https://github.com/music-assistant/frontend), or [models](https://github.com/music-assistant/models)).
 - Write the code for your music provider, player provider, metadata provider, or plugin.
 - Ensure tests pass and pre-commit hooks succeed (`pre-commit run --all-files`).
 - Create a Pull Request against the [**dev**](https://github.com/music-assistant/server/tree/dev) branch.

## Adding a provider to the server

A provider that ships with Music Assistant is installed for every user and supported by the project. A new one therefore asks for more than working code:

 - **People ask for it.** Link the feature request or discussion that shows the demand.
 - **It is documented.** A pull request on the [documentation](https://github.com/music-assistant/music-assistant.io/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) comes with it.
 - **It meets the standards.** It follows the [development guide](https://github.com/music-assistant/server/blob/dev/DEVELOPMENT.md) and the [usage policy](https://github.com/music-assistant/.github/blob/main/USAGE_POLICY.md), passes the automated checks and has tests of its own.
 - **You maintain it.** You are listed as its maintainer and keep following up on bug reports and on changes in the service, the device or the server.

A provider whose maintainer no longer follows up may be moved out of the server to the [community catalog](https://github.com/music-assistant/.github/blob/main/COMMUNITY_CATALOG_RULES.md). That is announced first, so that someone can take it over.
